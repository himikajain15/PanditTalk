# 🚀 How to Start PanditTalk - Quick Guide

## ✅ Easiest Way - Just Double Click!

**Double-click `start.bat` or `start_all.bat`** from the `C:\Pandittalk` folder.

That's it! Both servers will start automatically in separate windows.

---

## 📋 What Happens:

1. ✅ **Backend Server** starts on `http://localhost:8000`
2. ✅ **Frontend** starts and opens in Chrome browser
3. ✅ Two new terminal windows open (keep them open!)

---

## 🧪 Test Login:

- **Username/Email**: `testuser` or `test@pandittalk.com`
- **Password**: `test123456`

Or click "Register" to create a new account!

---

## 🛑 To Stop:

Just close the two terminal windows that opened.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting:

### If backend doesn't start:
- Make sure you're in `C:\Pandittalk` folder
- Check if virtual environment exists in `backend\venv\`
- Install dependencies: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`

### If frontend doesn't start:
- Make sure Flutter is installed: `flutter doctor`
- Check if Chrome browser is installed

That's all! Enjoy your app! 🙏
